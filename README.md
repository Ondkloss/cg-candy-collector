# ![Gecko logo](src/images/logo16.png "Gecko logo") CoinGecko Candy Collector

If you have a tab open with <https://www.coingecko.com/en/candy> (or other localization) this extension automatically injects JavaScript to periodically check and click on the candy collect button when it is available.

The extension icon also has an indicator if you do not have the tab open, and can be clicked to open/select the candy tab.
